Title: Compute Lethal Doses (LD) with Confidence Intervals

Description: Compute lethal doses for count data based on generalized additive models (GAMs)
	together with parametric bootstrap confidence intervals for the lethal dose. The package
 	is designed for experiments with counts as outcome, which need a separate preparation
	for each measurment. Examples for such experiments are survival experiments where the
	survival is measured as the number of colony forming units (c.f.u.). In this case,
	one cannot measure one prepartation multiple times with various doses but one needs
	one experiment (with one or more biological replicates) for each dose.
